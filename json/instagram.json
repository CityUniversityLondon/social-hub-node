Wednesday\n\nFeeling sore and stiff after coming to the gym? Here‚Äôs 5 ways to help prevent delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) \n\n1. Get moving. - Don't allow your muscles to seize up, get out for a walk or cycle to get the blood flowing.\n\n2. Stay hydrated - You need to replace all the fluids you've lost through exercising. A lack of electrolytes will contribute to the soreness.\n\n3. Foam Roll/Stretching - Your muscles will become very tight very quickly without stretching or massaging them. We can help relax the muscles by using these techniques. Foam rolling can be used as a form of massage.\n\n4. Warm/cold baths - A cold bath will constrict your blood vessels and cause new blood to circulate through and flush out waste products. A warm bath will then open up those vessels and allow the fresh blood to circulate easier.\n\n5. Rest - This is the main time your body is able to recover and your muscles repair from exercise. Having a good sleep routine aiming for 8 hours of sleep a night will reduce muscle soreness.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/citysportec1","timeElapsed":"a month ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcSrFcirXk3/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/278340050_503826328060272_8520469493746538322_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=jwep2TgIXyAAX-bpZCw&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT_vjW94x8cWBID0nBqM7IO4c8nUFfcD3i6z21ceeOZcNA&oe=62809417","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220225","postId":"17935205758878043","timeCreated":1645781349,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"Member%20Notice%0A%0AThis%20follow%20up%20email%20is%20being%20sent%20due%20to%20a%20date%20error%20in%20our%20previous%20mandated%20communication.%20We%20apologise%20for%20the%20necessity%20of%20this%20follow-up.%20Please%20read%20below%20and%20note%20our%20open%20day%20will%20be%20Thursday%2C%20rather%20than%20Wednesday%20as%20previously%20stated.%0A%0AAs%20a%20result%20of%20further%20industrial%20action%2C%20some%20buildings%20of%20City%2C%20University%20of%20London%20(including%20CitySport)%2C%20will%20unfortunately%20be%20closed%20from%20Monday%2028th%C2%A0February%20to%20Wednesday%202nd%C2%A0March%202022.%20This%20is%20due%20to%20the%20reduced%20number%20of%20colleagues%20in%20security%20roles%20available%20for%20work%20on%20these%20dates.%0A%0AEnsuring%20the%20health%20and%20safety%20of%20all%20CitySport%20users%20is%20our%20priority%2C%20and%20without%20alternative%20staff%20who%20have%20the%20sufficient%20level%20of%20safety%20training%2C%20we%20cannot%20safely%20open%20the%20facility.%0A%0APlease%20do%20not%20travel%20in%20to%20use%20CitySport%20on%20these%20days%2C%20as%20our%20facility%20will%20be%20closed.%0A%0AWe%20are%20working%20hard%20to%20keep%20our%20buildings%20open%20on%20strike%20days%20wherever%20possible%2C%20and%20put%20in%20place%20the%20necessary%20health%20and%20safety%20measures%20to%20keep%20the%20facility%20open.%0A%0ATime%20lost%20due%20to%20industrial%20action%20will%20be%20reflected%20in%20lieu%20for%20prepaid%20memberships%2C%20and%20as%20a%20reduction%20for%20direct%20debit%20memberships.%0A%0AWe%20will%20post%20any%20updates%20on%20our%20website%2C%20and%20social%20media%20channels%20(Instagram%20and%20Facebook)%20which%20will%20continue%20to%20remain%20active%20throughout%20this%20time.%0A%0AWe%20are%20very%20sorry%20for%20the%20inconvenience%20this%20may%20cause.%20We%20plan%20to%20reopen%20CitySport%20on%20Thursday%203rd%C2%A0March%202022.%0A%0AKind%20Regards%0A%0AThe%20CitySport%20Team","linkedText":"Member Notice\n\nThis follow up email is being sent due to a date error in our previous mandated communication.

process vital functions over 24 hours cycles.\n¬†\nConsistently waking up and sleeping at the same time each day will aid your sleep-wake cycle and create a good routine for your body to adjust to.\n¬†\n3Ô∏è‚É£Caffeine Limits\nStudies have shown that caffeine consumed 6 hours before sleep negatively contributed both to the quality and duration of sleep.\n¬†\nLimiting caffeine consumption in the evening will reduce its effect and help you sleep quicker.\n¬†\n4Ô∏è‚É£Melatonin\nMelatonin is a hormone released at night which contributes to us falling asleep.\n¬†\nFoods such as cherries, berries, kiwi, milk and fish all have high levels of melatonin or contribute to the production of other hormones that aid sleep.\n¬†\n5Ô∏è‚É£Sleeping Environment\nYour bedroom should be associated with sleep and relaxation.\n¬†\nStudies show that using your room as a place to work, watch tv and eat meals will start to break that association and cause difficulties when preparing to sleep.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/citysportec1","timeElapsed":"2 months

D, the \"sunshine vitamin\" (absorbed through sunlight), offers a range of benefits, from positives for both physical and mental health. We will also discuss enriched foods and daily intake.\n‚†Ä\n---Healthy bones\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption and helps maintain adequate blood levels of calcium and phosphorus. This in turn provides us with stronger, healthier bones, and reduces the risk of injury and fractures.‚†Ä\n ‚†Ä\n---Vitamin D may fight disease\nResearch has shown that an increase in this vitamin can aid in decreasing the chance of heart disease. Low levels have been linked to increased risk of diseases such as hypertension, heart failure and stroke.It has also been shown to support immune health.‚†Ä\n ‚†Ä\n---May regulate mood and reduce depression\nIn recent studies, subjects who were experiencing negative emotions were later supplemented with vitamin D and later noticed an improvement in symptoms.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚Å£-----------------‚Å£-----------------‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n‚Äî-Some foods that include Vitamin D are:\nFishes (salmon, sardines, herring, canned tuna)‚†Ä\ncod liver oil‚†Ä\nbeef liver‚†Ä\nred meat‚†Ä\negg yolk‚†Ä\nshrimp‚†Ä\nregular mushrooms‚†Ä\nmilk, yoghurt, and non-dairy alternatives (fortified)‚†Ä\ncertain cereals, and oatmeal (fortified)‚†Ä\norange juice (fortified)‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf dietary limitations hold you back from consuming most of things listed, an alternative is supplementation. It usually comes in two forms (Vitamin D2 ans Vitamin D3 - most potent of the two).‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nBecause vitamin D is fat-soluble, eating it with fatty foods may help increase its absorption.‚†Ä\n ‚†Ä\n---Recommended daily intake‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThis will vary on factors such as age, ethnicity, climate exposer, and seasons. it is recommended to have at least 10-20 micrograms a day,but a drastic increase may be required if you are not exposed to the sun or have darker skin tones.‚†Ä\n ‚†Ä\n---Summary‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nVitamin D is essential for bone health and many other aspects of health. Deficiency is prevalent and may have health consequences for many people.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nIf you are thinking about adding more vitamin D to your diet, consider the following factors and speak with a professional health advisor.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nMake sure to follow us for more health and fitness related content.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/citysportec1","timeElapsed":"10 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CdBKJhlNfkE/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/279610311_535182351349009_7427944789281299978_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=X-MOGUnXJ80AX_Xbg17&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT8RadIklLgR1m9p_HyR3buK8t8pYLIlxyZJidmoZhjKFA&oe=628113E7","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220427","postId":"17968434490597623","timeCreated":1651066334,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"April%20marks%20stress%20awareness%20month.%20Here%20is%205%20ways%20to%20help%20reduce%20stress%E2%80%A6%0A%20%0A1.%20Keep%20active%0AExercising%20will%20reduce%20some%20of%20the%20emotional%20intensity%20that%20you're%20feeling%2C%20clearing%20your%20thoughts%2C%20and%20letting%20you%20deal%20with%20your%20problems%20more%20calmly.%20Regular%20exercise%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20improve%20symptoms%20of%20common%20mental%20health%20conditions%20such%20as%20anxiety%20and%20depression%0A%0A2.%20Connect%20with%20friends%20and%20family%20%0AA%20good%20support%20network%20of%20colleagues%2C%20friends%20and%20family%20can%20ease%20your%20work%20troubles%20and%20help%20you%20see%20things%20in%20a%20different%20way.%20We%20often%20have%20a%20good%20laugh%20with%20them%2C%20which%20is%20an%20excellent%20stress%20reliever.%0A%0A3.%20Spend%20some%20%E2%80%98me%E2%80%99%20time%20%0ATaking%20time%20for%20yourself%20is%20essential%20to%20living%20a%20healthy%20life.%20Studies%20show%20that%20people%20who%20engage%20in%20self-care%20report%20lower%20levels%20of%20stress%20and%20improved%20quality%20of%20life%2C%20while%20a%20lack%20of%20self-care%20is%20associated%20with%20higher%20risk%20of%20stress%20and%20burnout%0A%0A4.%20Have%20a%20healthy%20diet%0AMinimizing%20your%20intake%20of%20highly%20processed%20foods%20and%20beverages%20and%20eating%20more%20whole%20foods%20such%20as%20vegetables%2C%20fruits%2C%20beans%2C%20fish%2C%20nuts%2C%20and%20seeds%20can%20help%20ensure%20that%20your%20body%20is%20properly%20nourished.%20In%20turn%2C%20this%20may%20improve%20your%20resilience%20to%20stress.%0A%0A5.%20Ensure%20you%20get%20enough%20sleep%0AA%20good%20night's%20sleep%20makes%20you%20able%20to%20tackle%20the%20day's%20stress%20more%20easily.%20When%20you%E2%80%99re%20tired%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20less%20patient%20and%20more%20easily%20agitated%2C%20which%20can%20increase%20stress.%20Most%20adults%20need%207%20to%209%20hours%20of%20sleep%20each%20night.","linkedText":"April marks stress awareness month. Here is 5 ways to help reduce stress‚Ä¶\n \n1. Keep active\nExercising will reduce some of the emotional intensity that you're feeling, clearing your thoughts, and letting you deal with your problems more calmly. Regular exercise has been shown to improve symptoms of common mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression\n\n2. Connect with friends and family \nA good support network of colleagues, friends and family can ease your work troubles and help you see things in a different way. We often have a good laugh with them, which is an excellent stress reliever.\n\n3. Spend some ‚Äòme‚Äô time \nTaking time for yourself is essential to living a healthy life. Studies show that people who engage in self-care report lower levels of stress and improved quality of life, while a lack of self-care is associated with higher risk of stress and burnout\n\n4. Have a healthy diet\nMinimizing your intake of highly processed foods and beverages and eating more whole foods such as vegetables, fruits, beans, fish, nuts, and seeds can help ensure that your body is properly nourished. In turn, this may improve your resilience to stress.\n\n5. Ensure you get enough sleep\nA good night's sleep makes you able to tackle the day's stress more easily. When you‚Äôre tired, you‚Äôre less patient and more easily agitated, which can increase stress. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/citysportec1","timeElapsed":"14 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc2zWm2thvw/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/279174755_1737176606632379_3456568320555832384_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=L_SyzBRg774AX-UmulV&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT-ZPH9sSWBLXxlmDU3rlobbwsUb0VSerIjXx77jPRurxw&oe=62808220","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220406","postId":"17936812673066078","timeCreated":1649260459,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"cityunisu","screenName":"cityunisu","text":"%F0%9F%8E%89Congrats%20to%20the%20newly%20elected%20assembly%20members!!%20%0A%0ASwipe%20through%20to%20see%20who%20they%20are%20by%20school!","linkedText":"üéâCongrats to the newly elected assembly members!! \n\nSwipe through to see who they are by school!","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunisu","timeElapsed":"a month ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcA-67BNpnB/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/277955782_1632639393765214_5032772936901436974_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=N62kilkMR2YAX9jOM4y&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT9e7UB4O7eax18WK3yVQKqeLdUn8KM7nC7kZRnTLESb9Q&oe=627FEDFB","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220406","postId":"17936381323930977","timeCreated":1649242995,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"Ramadan%20Nutrition%20%0A%20%0ABefore%20Fasting%20(Sehri)%0ASehri%20should%20be%20a%20combination%20of%20all%20food%20groups%20to%20give%20you%20the%20required%20nutrition.%20Eating%20starchy%20foods%20at%20Sehri%20will%20provide%20energy%20during%20the%20day%2C%20while%20high%20fibre%20or%20wholegrain%20foods%20such%20as%20wholegrain%20bread%2C%20cereal%2C%20oat%2C%20and%20porridge%20keep%20you%20feeling%20fuller%20during%20the%20day%20and%20aid%20digestion.%20Dairy%20products%20such%20as%20milk%20and%20yoghurt%20are%20a%20good%20choice%20for%20Sehri%2C%20likewise%20Eggs%20are%20a%20great%20source%20of%20Protein%20too.%20%0A%20%0AAfter%20Fasting%20(Iftar)%0AIftar%20should%20be%20a%20well-balanced%20nutritious%20meal.%20Incorporate%20foods%20from%20all%20major%20food%20groups%3B%20i.e.%20a%20combination%20of%20starchy%20foods%2C%20protein%20rich%20foods%20like%20meat%2C%20fish%2C%20eggs%20and%20beans%2C%20dairy%20products%20and%2C%20vegetables.%20Consuming%20fibre-rich%20food%20is%20important%20as%20they%20aid%20in%20digestion.","linkedText":"Ramadan Nutrition \n \nBefore Fasting (Sehri)\nSehri should be a combination of all food groups to give you the required nutrition.

It‚Äôs about being persistent, dedicated and adaptable- Whether that's in life, university or your career.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunicareers","timeElapsed":"2 months ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ca76rB_ghQD/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/275569603_1130085501174636_1963319683403242459_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=imoE0AqfgXwAX_inoPc&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT-C1gCVODbd1B0cVNhIingtPI0m9HPaHiIh3bYmyhfEtw&oe=627FA031","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220407","postId":"17972817478538155","timeCreated":1649326316,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"cityunisu","screenName":"cityunisu","text":"%F0%9F%AA%B4SUSTAINABILITY%20WEEK%E2%80%A6%0A%0AIs%20kicking%20off%20TOMORROW%20with%20a%20huge%20Kilo%20sale%20in%20the%20Pavilion!%20%0A%0AThis%20is%20your%20chance%20to%20get%20your%20hands%20on%20some%20amazing%20vintage%20garms%20while%20being%20super%20sustainable%20%F0%9F%8C%8D%0A%0ASave%20the%20planet%20and%20look%20good%20doing%20it%20at%20the%20Pavilion%20tomorrow%2010am-5pm!","linkedText":"ü™¥SUSTAINABILITY WEEK‚Ä¶\n\nIs kicking off TOMORROW with a huge Kilo sale in the Pavilion! \n\nThis is your chance to get your hands on some amazing vintage garms while being super sustainable üåç\n\nSave the planet and look good doing it at the Pavilion tomorrow 10am-5pm!","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunisu","timeElapsed":"a month ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcC8iFttU54/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/277903265_274207941579632_4911394396500527645_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=TU4moE_tuewAX93Hyb1&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT_kon0f7uhoRr_-_CVg6oXd-3ZkC1xhdg6ifkril62Esg&oe=62805239","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220404","postId":"17929683011038860","timeCreated":1649059230,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"cityunisu","screenName":"cityunisu","text":"Update%3A%20voting%20has%20now%20closed!%20%0A%0AIt's%209am%20and%20voting%20for%20this%20years'%20elections%20has%20officially%20opened!%20%0A%0AYou%20have%20until%20%206%3A30pm%20Tomorrow%20to%20get%20your%20votes%20in!%0A%0AMake%20sure%20you%20head%20over%20to%20the%20link%20in%20our%20bio%20to%20find%20out%20more!%0A%0A%23CitySUelections%20%23Citysu%20%23elections%20%23cityuniversityoflondon%20%23universityoflondon","linkedText":"Update: voting has now closed! \n\nIt's 9am and voting for this years' elections has officially opened! \n\nYou have until  6:30pm Tomorrow to get your votes in!\n\nMake sure you head over to the link in our bio to find out more!\n\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/CitySUelections\">@CitySUelections</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/Citysu\">@Citysu</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/elections\">@elections</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/cityuniversityoflondon\">@cityuniversityoflondon</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/universityoflondon\">@universityoflondon</a>","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunisu","timeElapsed":"a month ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb6_FXFr-kq/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/277701556_166833652436268_4623694902352144328_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=qM8killiBd8AX88Hmkk&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT9IAxkqE-MKzpU-AY6a9-SLgLaY7_kveM0-cseHA_KHYg&oe=627FB133","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220308","postId":"17942721619764132","timeCreated":1646737080,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"Today%20CitySport%20celebrates%20International%20Women%E2%80%99s%20Day%20to%20encourage%20women%20to%20use%20sport%20and%20exercise%20as%20a%20way%20to%20break%20the%20bias.%20Watch%20our%20video%20to%20empower%20female%20activity%20and%20become%20the%20best%20version%20of%20you.%20Your%20gender%20should%20not%20define%20your%20success!%0A%0ACan%20you%20see%20yourself%20in%20our%20video%3F%20Like%20and%20share%20to%20show%20your%20support","linkedText":"Today CitySport celebrates International Women‚Äôs Day to encourage women to use sport and exercise as a way to break the bias.

Why is that? \n.\n.\n.Help, be it feedback, just putting stuff out there or sharing our work, can make all the difference in the world, offer a new perspective, creative space between us and whatever we‚Äôre creating.\n.\n.\n.\n.COME JOIN ME- to look at developmental tools, as well as the opportunity to share something you might be stuck with, or simply to help bring it to life.\n.\n.\n.SATURDAY 19th MARCH 2-5pm @vortexjazzclub for just ¬£50\n.\n.\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/songwriting\">@songwriting</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/composition\">@composition</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/practice\">@practice</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/technique\">@technique</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/creativity\">@creativity</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/inspiration\">@inspiration</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/vocalist\">@vocalist</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/singersongwriter\">@singersongwriter</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/jazz\">@jazz</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/folk\">@folk</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/singersofinstagram\">@singersofinstagram</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/songwritingworkshop\">@songwritingworkshop</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/jazzsongwriting\">@jazzsongwriting</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/folk\">@folk</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/comparisonisthethiefofjoy\">@comparisonisthethiefofjoy</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/independentartist\">@independentartist</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/feedback\">@feedback</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/critique\">@critique</a>","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunimusic","timeElapsed":"2 months ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cazz9MUgNbl/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/275402280_710522006996415_4304208690336478573_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=RdKUlh15iSsAX9EiXb8&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT99qBxFKeWR8YQsxDk0Ok1ygOzJakMrqwI37DN-n_OyUA&oe=627FDC51","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220413","postId":"17984203279487740","timeCreated":1649857914,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"cityunimusic","screenName":"cityunimusic","text":"BMus%20student%20%40gregorialoth%20performs%20a%20recital%20next%20week%20on%20Thursday%2021st%20April%20-%20check%20it%20out!%0AReally%20interesting%20looking%20programme%20performed%20by%20Gregor%20and%20his%20mother%20Maud%20Hodson%20on%20cello.","linkedText":"BMus student @gregorialoth performs a recital next week on Thursday 21st April - check it out!\nReally interesting looking programme performed by Gregor and his mother Maud Hodson on cello.","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityunimusic","timeElapsed":"a month ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CcSyehDqREh/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/278494179_1092414174940692_6895647692565230206_n.webp?stp=dst-jpg&_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-6&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=cYnX4d5foz0AX_bF8VP&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=00_AT8DS3mp6kzLlJISP1WyX5Xd8GWQAr8Ct4wQemdol6P4lQ&oe=62800A7B","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20220422","postId":"17914772369445518","timeCreated":1650635395,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"Fasting%20for%20so%20many%20hours%20during%20Ramadan%20will%20have%20an%20impact%20on%20how%20much%20you%20can%20exercise.%20It%20is%20recommended%20that%20those%20who%20are%20fasting%20should%20stick%20to%20mainly%20low-intensity%20strength-based%20exercises.%20Here%20is%20a%20list%20of%20compound-based%20exercises%20that%20can%20help%20you%20stay%20healthy%20during%20Ramadan%3A%0A%0A%20%0A%0ASquats%20%E2%80%93%203%20sets%2C%2010-12%20repetitions%0A%0ALunges%20%E2%80%93%203%20sets%2C%2010-12%20repetitions%20(on%20each%20leg)%0A%0APush-ups%20%E2%80%93%203%20sets%2C%2010-12%20repetitions%0A%0APull-ups%20%E2%80%93%203%20sets%2C%205-8%20repetitions%0A%0APlanks%20%E2%80%93%203%20sets%2C%2030%20seconds%20working%2C%2030%20seconds%20rest%0A%0A%23feelgoodfriday%20%23unigym%20%23studentgym%20%23studentfitness%20%23studenthealth%20%23fitnessgym%20%23stayactivestayfit%20%23unisport%20%23unisportlife%20%23healthystudent%20%23studentwellness%20%23studentwellbeing%20%23citysport%20%23citygym%20%23cityftness%20%23fitness%20%23fitnessclasses%20%23fitnessclass%20%23onlinefitness%20%23onlineclass%20%23reopening%20%23membership%20%23healthyeating%20%23ramadan","linkedText":"Fasting for so many hours during Ramadan will have an impact on how much you can exercise.

Swipe to take a look at what we got up to. üëâüèæ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n2. We welcomed over 20 brilliant start-ups for our impactful accelerator programmes!‚ö°Ô∏èWe are extremely fortunate to have support from our accommodating network of our workshop facilitators and mentors, and managed to host both programmes online.  From social media to sales, insurance to persona building, they covered it all!  Keep an eye out on our Instagram page for updates about our next cohort. üëÄ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n3. To help tackle the financial strain due to the pause in revenue generation during the pandemic, together with @cityuniventures, @cityuniversitylondon‚Äôs Research and Enterprise team and Santander UK Universities, we were able to provide over ¬£80,000 in grants to our members to allow them to pivot, build long term resilience plans and pursue new opportunities. üìù ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n4. Since the launch in March 2020, we hosted over 100 online mentoring sessions via our mentoring programme!üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Following the lockdown, we welcomed our fantastic community of mentors to host sessions for our members.

At this time, it‚Äôs even more important that you prioritise your self-care. This might mean making time to meet with friends or heading out for a walk to take a break from your studies. \n\n@cityuniversitylondon @cityunichaplaincy @citysueducation @citymentalhealthsociety
