But just as a dog is not just for Christmas but for life, I and so many others have also always maintained that Black history is not just for October ‚Äì but for 365 days of the year. Large sections of society do not suddenly stop being Black on November the 1st. \n\n\"Over the coming months, I'm looking forward to getting started in the new student engagement officer role and exploring better ways to support students in need. I'm also looking forward to helping to organize The Stephen Lawrence Day Event awards, a joint project with the Rio Ferdinand Foundation, Kickoffat3 and Take the Reins, which aims to take inner city youth out of the city and give them opportunities to get behind the scenes of more ‚Äòrural‚Äô sports, such as horse racing, with a view to also providing employment opportunities.\" ‚ú®","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityuniversitylondon","timeElapsed":"6 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUwxGN8grtx/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/244511600_167701525459568_6713092013534582140_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=eYCzlQw8HjIAX-hwe2W&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=3c0a226b8a0dd021615d4bd1444acc96&oe=616D447F","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20211011","postId":"18172263202195543","timeCreated":1633954887,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"When you arrive to CitySport please help us creating a safe and clean environment for all by paying attention to our ground rules.\n\n1.
