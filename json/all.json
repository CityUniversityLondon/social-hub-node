This year's theme – as announced by the World Federation for Mental Health – is Mental Health in an Unequal World.\n\nWe'll be sharing a number of resources throughout the day across our social channels, so keep an eye out. You can also rewatch our mental health themed takeover from Friday with members of @citymentalhealthsociety and the Mental Health team. (Click the ‘WMHD❤️’ highlight on our profile)\n\nRemember, there is always support available should you need it 🙏\n\n(Thanks to Dr Emily Stacey (Department of International Politics, Visiting Lecturer) for the photo of College Building 📸)\n\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/MyCityUni\">@MyCityUni</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/WMHD2021\">@WMHD2021</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/MentalHealth\">@MentalHealth</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/MentalHealthAwareness\">@MentalHealthAwareness</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/CityUniversityofLondon\">@CityUniversityofLondon</a>","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityuniversitylondon","timeElapsed":"4 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CU10eQlAjjv/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/244886314_347752600419625_5491998593673550705_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=tPdOccEcsDMAX_AjwWq&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=c5e8a56df977da400e96371edbfef38e&oe=616C3B92","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20211008-0","postId":"17845723529662399","timeCreated":1633722024,"type":"Instagram","fullName":"citysportec1","screenName":"citysportec1","text":"Our fitness instructor Jesse and @anthonyjoshua training together 🔥🔥🔥🥊🥊\n\n#blackhistorymonth #blackhistoryhero #blackhistorychallenge #boxingtraining #boxing","linkedText":"Our fitness instructor Jesse and @anthonyjoshua training together 🔥🔥🔥🥊🥊\n\n<a href=\"http://instagram.com/blackhistorymonth\">@blackhistorymonth</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/blackhistoryhero\">@blackhistoryhero</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/blackhistorychallenge\">@blackhistorychallenge</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/boxingtraining\">@boxingtraining</a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/boxing\">@boxing</a>","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/citysportec1","timeElapsed":"6 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUxyD1-gwFG/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/244521635_3013435865545626_3012596312048233734_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=jRlChdJJdowAX8t6jBo&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=8e6a546e8f72fc9141702253a7f4246f&oe=616D45F0","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20211008-1","postId":1446525811377545200,"timeCreated":1633713603,"type":"Twitter","fullName":"CityUniCareers","screenName":"CityUniCareers","text":"Meet our hard-working Career Consultants!\n\nWhy not get to know a little more about each of our consultants?

But just as a dog is not just for Christmas but for life, I and so many others have also always maintained that Black history is not just for October – but for 365 days of the year. Large sections of society do not suddenly stop being Black on November the 1st. \n\n\"Over the coming months, I'm looking forward to getting started in the new student engagement officer role and exploring better ways to support students in need. I'm also looking forward to helping to organize The Stephen Lawrence Day Event awards, a joint project with the Rio Ferdinand Foundation, Kickoffat3 and Take the Reins, which aims to take inner city youth out of the city and give them opportunities to get behind the scenes of more ‘rural’ sports, such as horse racing, with a view to also providing employment opportunities.\" ✨","accountUrl":"https://instagram.com/cityuniversitylondon","timeElapsed":"6 days ago","itemUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/p/CUwxGN8grtx/","imageUrl":"https://scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/244511600_167701525459568_6713092013534582140_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=eYCzlQw8HjIAX-hwe2W&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-2.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANQ71j8EAAAA&oh=3c0a226b8a0dd021615d4bd1444acc96&oe=616D447F","videoId":null},{"itemRef":"20211008-15","postId":1446401277223637000,"timeCreated":1633683911,"type":"Twitter","fullName":"CityUniCareers","screenName":"CityUniCareers","text":"Looking to explore your career options?
